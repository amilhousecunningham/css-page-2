            <h1>Web Design and Development with Charlotte</h1>
            
            <h2>Background</h2>
        
            <p>In August of 2016, I interviewed a professional web designer in the Carrollton community to learn about the tools and processes used in web design today, from the perspective of a practicing web designer. The main points from the interview are noted below.</p>
        </header>       
        
        <div>
        
        <h2>How long have you been designing websites?</h2>
        
        <p>I have been designing websites for about ten years. It began as a hobby when I was about 12 years old. I taught myself how to do it, and I realized I really liked coding, and I eventually went into computer science as a major in college.</p>

        <h2>What is Your Process for Buiding a Website for a Client?</h2>
        
        <h3>1) Gather Information</h3>
       
        <p>It starts with talking to the client, getting them to fill out the website questionnaire (or, in some cases asking them the questions and filling in the answers myself).</p>
        
        <h3>2) Collect Assets</h3>
        
        <p>From there I collect any assets that the client might have, such as existing websites, brochures, logo, images, etc. I might also get them to browse image sites like IStockPhoto to pick out content for their site.</p>
        
        <h3>3) Brainstorm</h3>

        <p>Depending on the site, and the resources I have at the time, I might start sketching things out on scraps of paper, or I might use an image editing program (like Microsoft Paint) or even Gimp (A free, open source image editing program that is sort of like Photoshop's little brother) or inkscape (Adobe Illustrator's little brother). I just bought a new tablet (it comes in today) and I hope to be able to use that in place of paper (it has a stylus).</p>
        
        <p>For the brainstorming, I just throw together a bunch of ideas. Sometimes it takes a while to get something good, sometimes the first thing that pops into my head ends up turning out great.  For example, I recently built a site for a rental property in Florida. They had this great image of chairs on the beach from right out in front of the hotel. The horizon line made a great divider, and then the sand all transitioned to a about the same tone at the bottom. For that one, I thought, what if I put the Logo and tag line up above the horizon, in the sky, and then have the nav bar down below the sand, and for the site, continue that sand color as a background?</p>

        <h3>4) Make mockups</h3>
        
        <p>Once I have an idea, I work on implementing it. If I think it will be really complicated to implement in HTML, I'll use an image editor. This is probably the more common approach, but I often find that I'm nearly as fast working in HTML as I am in the image editor. Partially because I never took the time to get really good with an image editor, and partly because HTML and CSS just make sense to me in a way that they don't seem to for most people. I try to always have a few options for the client, even if they have a lot in common.</p>

        <h3>5) Get client feedback</h3>
        
        <p>Once I have some mockups to show the client, I will get in touch with them and get their feedback. I ask them to pick one of the mockups, or to tell me what they like from each mockup.</p>

        <h3>6) Make changes</h3>
        
        <p>Based on the client feedback, I make the requested changes, and sometimes others that come to mind as I work with the site.</p>
        
        <h3>7) Repeat Steps 5 and 6 Until the Client Likes the Design</h3>
        <p>This is usually the most time consuming part. Most sites have 3-6 iterations like this. Some have a lot more. It really depends on the size of the site and how picky/detail oriented your client is.</p>

        <h3>8) Implement the Chosen Design</h3>
        
        <p>If I went with a HTML based mockup, this part is a lot easier. If I didn't, then I have to do that now. If I used an image based solution, sometimes I find that getting the site pixel-perfect would be really difficult and I will go back to the client with alternative design ideas.</p>

        <h3>9) Test! Test! Test!</h3>

        <p>As the title says, test! Test the site in different browsers (IE, Edge, Firefox, Chrome, Safari) on different devices (Ipad, Iphone, Android tablet, Android Phone, Windows phone, etc.) Services like Browser Stack are useful here. Browser Stack lets you test on devices that you don't have physical access to.</p>

        <h3>10) Final Approval</h3>

        <p>Show it to the client one last time and make sure everything is good.</p>
        
        <h3>11) Deploy the Site</h3>

        <p>Normally the client buys a hosting plan either from me or from somewhere like HostGator or GoDaddy). I get the login credentials and go set the site up on that hosting account.</p>
        
        <h3>12) Train the Client</h3>
        <p>I always offer 1 hour of training for free with all of my websites. I usually go meet the client and walk them through how to update their site. For remote clients I'll contact them over the phone or through skype.</p>
    
    
        <h2>What kinds of questions do you ask of clients?</h2>
        
        <p>I usually send them this questionnaire (with prettier formatting):</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Do you have an existing site? If not, do you have a web address (url) in mind?</li>
            <li>Will you want email addresses at your url (ex: your_name@your_website.com)?</li>
            <li>What is the purpose of this site?</li>
            <li>Who is your target audience?</li>
            <li>When will you need the site completed?</li>
            <li>What is your budget for this site?</li>
            <li>Do you have an idea of what you want this site to look like (color scheme, layout, etc.)?</li>
            <li>How often will the content of the site change?</li>
            <li>Do you want to edit the content yourself, or would you like to have us update it?</li>
            <li>How many pages do you think your site will have?</li></ul>

        <p>I also ask them, "Which of the features would you like for your site (mark all that apply)":</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>[  ] Blog</li>
            <li>[  ] Contact Form</li>
            <li>[  ] Newsletter Signup</li>
            <li>[  ] Photo Gallery</li>
            <li>[  ] Store with checkout</li>
            <li>[  ] Event Calendar</li>
            <li>[  ] Event registration</li>
            <li>[  ] Payment processing</li>
            <li>[  ] Social Media integration</li>
            <li>[  ] Alternate mobile device Layout</li>
            <li>[  ] Search Engine Optimization</li>
            <li>[  ] Web Traffic Analytics (Google Analytics or similar)</li>
            <li>[  ] Other (Please explain)</li></ul>
    
        
        <h2>What types of languages do you need to know to do web design?</h2>
        
        <p>This is sort of a trick question. To do web design you don't need to know any languages at all (well, except for whatever language your client speaks so that you can talk to them…so…English?).</p>
        
        <p>To do web development you will need to know some sort of markup or programming language. There are tons of options. You can start out with basic HTML and CSS, then add in some simple JavaScript. That is all you really need to build a basic site.</p>
        
        <p>There are also a lot of frameworks you can use (like Wordpress). They do a lot of the coding for you, so you can do a lot with just css and html knowledge. If you want to do more you can always learn the language (wordpress uses PHP) and write plugins (and if you are feeling generous, share them with others).</p>

        <p>Back to the original (modified) question: What languages do you need to know to do web development?</p>
        
        <p>Knowing the language that your client(s) speak is really #1 (or have a really good translator).</p>
        
        <p>There are two "types" of web development: Front end and Back end. Front end is all about the "pretty" parts and making buttons do things when you click them, etc. Back end is about making sure that the data is saved to a database, the "business logic" is handled, etc.</p>
        
        <p>For the front end, you are basically restricted to HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Technically you could also use VBS (Visual Basic Script) but that limits you to the IE browser, so I won't go into that.</p>
        
        <p>For the back end, there are a ton of options. You could use javascript (node.js), python (Django,  twisted, etc.), Java (Struts, Spring, JSP, etc.), C# (.NET framework), PHP (with apache, nginx, etc.), and plenty more. Those are just the ones that I have worked with before and could remember off the top of my head.</p>
        
        <p>Choosing a framework is as important (or really, more important than) as choosing a language. Each language has several frameworks. Some will make a lot of sense; some will make you want to pull your hair out. Find one that makes sense to you or your group and work with that one.</p>
        
        <h2>What is your web design toolkit?</h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Pencil and paper.</li> 
            <li>A well-spec'd computer.</li>   
            <li>A slow computer/tablet/phone (to make sure "normal people" can use your site too).</li> 
            <li>Image Editors: Microsoft Paint, Gimp, Inkscape (vector graphics).</li> 
            <li>CMS: Wordpress </li> 
            <li>Text editors: Notepad ++ usually.</li> 
            <li>IDEs: Eclipse (free) or Intellij (free community edition, but I have the paid developer edition because for what I do it's worth it).</li> 
            <li>Testing Tools: Browser Stack</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What is the difference between Web Design and Web Development?</h2>
        
        <p><em>Web Design</em> is about how the website looks and how the user interacts with it (what does this button do, etc.).</p>
        
        <p><em>Web Development</em> is about turning the design into something that a user can actually use. They build the web site but they may not have had any input at all in the design.</p>
        
        <h2>How are plain text editors used in your process?</h2>
        
        <p>I don't use plain text editors much. If I am on windows I usually open notepad++, even for the most basic edits, because, why not?</p>
        
        <p>If I'm on Linux I'll use Kate (the KDE text editor) or VIM (a command line editor) for simple edits. Most of my real dev work is done in intellij though.</p>
        
        <h2>How are tools like Notepad++ used in your process?</h2>

        <p>Notepad++ allows me to make simple edits. It also has syntax highlighting, which makes code easier to read. There are also plugins that will do stuff like compare two files, or indent your code for you. It's not bad for small projects. It is also useful if you are on a slower computer.  There's a saying that having the best hardware you can afford makes the web design and/or development job much easier.</p>

        <h2>Do web developers use Dreamweaver anymore?   Why or why not?</h2>

        <p>I'm sure some do. I don't. It is targeted at people that don't want to or can't write code. It might be useful for mockups, but it adds a lot of junk to the html (just like Microsoft Frontpage used to). It definitely serves a purpose, but it's seen (at least by the people I run with) as a "training wheels" or "non-programmer" type of thing.</p>
 
        <h2>What applications are often involved in Front End Web Development?</h2>

        <h3>Web Design Applications</h3>
        
        <h4>HTML, a "Markup language"</h4>
        <p>Defines the structure of webpage content</p>

        <h4>CSS, a "Style sheet language"</h4>
        <p>Defines the look, feel, and design of webpage content</p>

        <h3>Front-end Applications</h3>

        <h4>JavaScript</h4>
        <p>Object-oriented "scripting language" that defines browser behaviours and user interactions</p>

        <h2>What applications are often involved in Back End Development?</h2>

        <h3>Server-side Languages</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>JavaScript (e.g., node.js)</li>
            <li>Python (e.g., Django, Twisted)</li>
            <li>Java (e.g., Struts, Spring, JSP)</li>
            <li>C# (e.g., .NET Framework)</li>
            <li>PHP (e.g., Apache, NGINX, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
       
        <h3>Database Languages</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>mySQL (for storing content)</li>
        </ul>
